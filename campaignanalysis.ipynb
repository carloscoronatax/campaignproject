    "# Analyzing Corporate Political Spending in Austin: Trends and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes political spending by companies in Austin, Texas, using a Kaggle dataset. We will investigate average payment amounts, annual expenditure trends, payment types, and the geographical distribution of payees. Additionally, we'll explore the role of political obligations and reimbursements while identifying key themes in expense descriptions. This analysis aims to provide insights into corporate influence in local elections.\n",

    "Following this introduction, the project will address the following key questions:\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Payee Location**: What is the geographic distribution of payees? Do they concentrate in any specific area within Austin, Texas?\n",
