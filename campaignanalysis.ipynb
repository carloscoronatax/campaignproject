    "# Analyzing Company Expenditures and Payees in Campaign Finance Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, I explored two key aspects of campaign finance data: average and median payment amounts and identifying top payees. Using pandas, I calculated the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Average and Median Payment Amounts**: I examined the distribution of payments made by companies, calculating both the average (mean) and median payment amounts to understand typical transaction sizes and detect any skewness in payment data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top 5 Payees with the Highest Total Expenditures**: By aggregating total expenditures for each payee, I identified the top 5 recipients of company payments. This provides insight into where a significant portion of the company's finances is directed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis reveals core financial patterns, highlighting average transaction sizes and the primary beneficiaries of company spending.\n",
